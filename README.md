Functional programming examples in Mathematica from old research. These are provided as an example of "real-world" Mathematica usage beyond what's covered in textbooks. 

## What's special about Mathematica?

"Wolfram Language," the language underlying Mathematica, is essentially a Lisp macro system using [M-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-expression) syntax. (The basic paradigm is that of a term rewriting system -- pattern matching -- so the analogy is closer to a macro system than a Lisp itself.)
